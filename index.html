            What if I told you I was born a different name? I mean geminis do tend to have spilt personality so that
            makes sense that I have two different names. With my father being a junior, you can assume that he would
            want for me to be named after him. But my mother was somewhat old school and if my father wanted me to
            be named after him then that would happen when they were married and Madison Chase Hodge was born. It
            wasn't until I was almost three that I became William Madison Sams III. As someone who grew up as an
            athlete that was what I was known as. I have always been the basketball guy. Moving to Arizona and
            recreating myself in the tech field has been a life changing experience that is tapping into a part of
            myself that I have wanted to express but never knew how to. I feel as this is more of my chase side that
            displays itself when I work with anything technology based. Welcome to the portfolio for Chase that will
            display my ability to be a full stack developer.
